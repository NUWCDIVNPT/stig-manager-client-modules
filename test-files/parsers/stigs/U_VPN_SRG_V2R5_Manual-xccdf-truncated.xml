In most VPN implementations, the banner is configured in the management backplane (NDM SRG) and serves as the presentation for the VPN client connection as well as for administrator logon to the device management tool/backplane.

System use notifications are required only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist. This requirement applies to VPN gateways that have the concept of a user account and have the logon function residing on the VPN gateway.

The banner must be formatted in accordance with applicable DoD policy. Use the following verbiage for VPN gateways that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants.

Remote access (e.g., RDP) is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include broadband and wireless.

Integrity checks include cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 186-4, Digital Signature Standard (DSS), specifies three NIST-approved algorithms: DSA, RSA, and ECDSA.
