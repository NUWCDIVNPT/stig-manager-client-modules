        <check-content>Verify the VPN Gateway has an inbound and outbound traffic security policy which is in compliance with information flow control policies (e.g., IPsec policy configuration).

Review network device configurations and topology diagrams. Verify encapsulated or encrypted traffic received from other enclaves with different security policies terminate at the perimeter for filtering and content inspection by a firewall and IDPS before gaining access to the private network.

If the IPsec VPN Gateway does not use Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) in tunnel mode for establishing secured paths to transport traffic between the organizations sites or between a gateway and remote end-stations, this is a finding,</check-content>

        <check-content>Verify the publicly accessible VPN Gateway displays the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system.  The banner must be formatted in accordance with DTM-08-060. Use the following verbiage for network elements that can accommodate banners of 1300 characters:

&quot;You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details.&quot;

Use the following verbiage for operating systems that have severe limitations on the number of characters that can be displayed in the banner:

&quot;I&apos;ve read &amp; consent to terms in IS user agreem&apos;t.&quot;

If the publicly accessible VPN Gateway does not display the Standard Mandatory DoD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system, this is a finding.</check-content>
